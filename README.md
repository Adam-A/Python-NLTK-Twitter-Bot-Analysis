### (Part 1) Categorization

We will train using democratic and republican tweets, and run the probabilities on the russian-troll-tweet to determine whether the tweets are demo or repub

We will need to separate the data and only use the tweet contents from the CSV. To do this, we will copy each tweet from the CSV content column into a file in a folder with "demo" and "repub" labels for each.

We will then use the trained models to predict probabilities on the russian-troll-tweets. 

### (Part 2) Concordance and POS

Our next analysis will be building concordance tabels. We will attempt to study the contexts of each words (undetermined yet). We will also tag the words from the tweets, and maybe analyze the parts of speech
